First_GUI
=========

My first GUI. For a mock company I made named 'Shirtopia'. Allows user to enter delivery information and select from 3 different shirts and sizes- with a quantity from 1-99. If the information is in a valid format, it writes the information to a txt file and reads it from the file as a confirmation.
